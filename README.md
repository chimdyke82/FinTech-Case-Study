According to prnewswire, NDAX offers seamless execution of high-volume block trades and gives access to a deep liquidity pool, industry-leading security, no price splippage, zero transaction confirmation and same-day settlements against a range of crypto- and fiat currencies. This is made possible because of its strong integration with the Canadian banking system. Clients' funds are held in segregated Canadian bank account and are fully guaranteed.

The company provides segregated crypto-asset accounts to wealth management groups, hedge funds and HNIs with multi-governance infrastructure which in turn provides customers full control over their assets.

The company also utilizes a Multi-Party Computation (MPC) technology for hot wallet management solutions amongst other measures and technologies used to manage the security of assets and data.

According to Crunchbase, NDAX uses 9 technology products and services including HTML5, Google Analytics and jQuery. The company it is actively using 6 technologies for its website

### Landscape
NDAX is a firm player in the blockchain and cryptocurrency domain of fintech. It is considered to be among the top best 3 crypto exchanges, an assessment done by Cryptohead.

Looking back, Blockchain technology is considered to have undergone three generations or stages highlighted by important developments and inventions. 

The first is the development of **Bitcoin** and digital currencies. This is followed by the emergence of **smart contracts** the next is smart contracts - mostly pioneered by the founders of Ethereum, and finally. and the third which is actually futuristic would be scalability. Many new crypto currencies have attempted this with varying degrees of success. 

Since the emergence of Bitcoin in 2009, the blockchain technology has grown in leaps and bounds. More developments have occurred in its application in smart contracts and simple payments. In November of 2015, the ERC-20 token standard was proposed and adopted. Over the years we have seen hardforks occur amongst leading cryptocurrencies in response to demands and loopholes. We have witnessed blockchain innovations in P2P payments, healthcare, supply chain, etc. Its use in the creation of financial services has exploded the reaches of trading, funds transfer etc. This is the major technology underlying the operations of NDAX.

According to Clutch, the top blockchain development companies in Canada include:
- ITM House
- Blockchain Foundary
- Bitswift Technology Solutions Inc
- Winterwind Inc
- Brainsmiths lab

According to BuyBitcoinworldwide, major echanges include:
- Bitbuy
- Netcoins
- Satstreet	



### Results
So far, this business enables:
- Highly secured financial transactions.
- Low transaction costs against traditional financial systems
- Faster transactions across the globe.
- Easy and seamless asset conversion and trade of cryptocurrencies or digital currencies for other assets including conventional fiat money or different digital currencies. 

The performance of the company relative to others in its field is hard to establish. Truth be told, the company is quite new and information about its financials is hardly out there in public domain. That said, there are lots of positive reviews for this comapany, indicating that the company is *doing something right.*

### Recommendations
The company appears to be more skewed to large volume trading and HNIs. I would recommend that it expands and makes its service more of a retail structure. The company already has a great thing going for it â€“ strong connection with the bank which makes same day asset conversion to fiat so easy, they should sign up more asset pairs to expand the reach and activity of their services. I would recommend the company to issue its own coins and encourage activity around its use. I would further recommend easier payment or settlement methods like use of cards such that individuals could easily make normal out of pocket or bills payments so seamless.   

I believe that this would strengthen its customer and capital base, turn up profitability and make it a more sustainable business as one of the largest already in Canada offering this kind of service.

One of the technologies that would be used is blockchain. This technology is necessary to encrypt the transaction information.
